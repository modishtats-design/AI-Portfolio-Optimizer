AI-Driven Financial Portfolio Optimizer

Overview

This project is an AI-powered portfolio optimizer built with Streamlit.
It integrates multiple advanced techniques to assist in investment
decision-making by analyzing market data, forecasting trends, and
optimizing portfolio allocations.

Key Features

1.  Market Data Fetching: Uses yfinance to fetch historical stock data
    for symbols like AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, SPY, and QQQ.
2.  LSTM Forecasting: Employs an LSTM neural network to forecast stock
    returns based on historical sequences.
3.  Portfolio Optimization:
    -   Sharpe Ratio Optimization
    -   Minimum Variance Optimization
    -   Maximum Return Optimization with volatility constraints
4.  Monte Carlo Simulation: Runs simulations to assess portfolio
    performance, calculate Value at Risk (VaR), and Conditional Value at
    Risk (CVaR).
5.  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Combines three agents
    (Return-focused, Risk-focused, Diversification-focused) to
    adaptively adjust portfolio weights.
6.  Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for user inputs, visualization
    of returns, correlations, optimization results, and simulation
    outputs.

Technologies Used

-   Python
-   Streamlit
-   yfinance
-   PyTorch
-   NumPy & Pandas
-   Plotly for interactive visualizations
-   SciPy for optimization

Usage

1.  Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2.  Run the app: streamlit run app.py
3.  Use the sidebar to set investment preferences, fetch market data,
    optimize portfolios, and run simulations.

Applications

-   Educational tool for learning portfolio optimization.
-   Assists traders and analysts in exploring different investment
    strategies.
-   Risk analysis and performance comparison using Monte Carlo
    simulations and multi-agent RL.
